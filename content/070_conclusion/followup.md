## Followup Session 

As a follow up to the SESummit cloud training and to make sure that all SEs understand the training content. Boubker and Laurent had an idea to set up a call the week after SKO and (3th of Feb) to review the content and give the opportunity to SE to ask questions that are still not clear. The call agenda will as follow:

•	Review the SKO content
•	Mapped McAfee solution to IaaS/PaaS
•	Q&A
